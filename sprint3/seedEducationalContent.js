    <h2>Transform Your Home into an Energy-Efficient Haven</h2>
    
    <p>Reducing energy consumption doesn't require major renovations. Here are 10 simple yet effective ways to make your home more energy-efficient:</p>
    
    <h3>1. Switch to LED Bulbs</h3>
    <p>LED bulbs consume up to 75% less energy than traditional incandescent bulbs and last 25 times longer. Replace your most-used lights first for maximum impact.</p>
    
    <h3>2. Unplug Electronics When Not in Use</h3>
    <p>Many devices draw power even when turned off. This "phantom load" can account for 5-10% of your electricity bill. Use power strips to easily disconnect multiple devices.</p>
    
    <h3>3. Adjust Your Thermostat</h3>
    <p>Lower your thermostat by 7-10 degrees when you're away from home. A programmable thermostat can save you up to 10% on heating and cooling costs.</p>
    
    <h3>4. Seal Air Leaks</h3>
    <p>Check for drafts around windows, doors, and electrical outlets. Use weatherstripping, caulk, or foam sealers to plug gaps and reduce heating/cooling loss.</p>
    
    <h3>5. Use Energy-Efficient Appliances</h3>
    <p>When replacing appliances, look for ENERGY STAR certified models. They use 10-50% less energy than standard appliances.</p>
    
    <h3>6. Maintain Your HVAC System</h3>
    <p>Change air filters regularly and schedule annual maintenance. A clean system runs more efficiently and lasts longer.</p>
    
    <h3>7. Use Natural Light</h3>
    <p>Open curtains and blinds during the day to reduce the need for artificial lighting. Consider installing skylights in dark areas.</p>
    
    <h3>8. Wash Clothes in Cold Water</h3>
    <p>About 90% of a washing machine's energy goes toward heating water. Cold water detergents work just as well for most loads.</p>
    
    <h3>9. Install Ceiling Fans</h3>
    <p>Ceiling fans use only about 75 watts of electricity and can make you feel 3-4 degrees cooler, allowing you to raise the thermostat setting.</p>
    
    <h3>10. Use Smart Power Strips</h3>
    <p>These automatically cut power to devices in standby mode, eliminating phantom loads without any effort on your part.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Start with one or two changes and gradually implement more. Small steps lead to significant energy savings!</strong></p>
